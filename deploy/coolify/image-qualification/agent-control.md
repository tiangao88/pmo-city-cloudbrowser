## Qualification evidence

The immutable digest was resolved from the GHCR manifest for the `sha-b83620a`
image tag after every Step-17 matrix job completed successfully. The CI job
also verified the non-root user, image healthcheck, provenance/SBOM metadata,
container health, runtime UID, and restricted agent-control health endpoint.
The agent-control boundary remains restricted to its allowlisted surface. No
credentials, cookies, tokens, passwords, or OTPs are included in this record.
