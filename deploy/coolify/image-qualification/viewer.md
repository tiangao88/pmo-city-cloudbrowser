## Qualification evidence

The immutable digest was resolved from the GHCR manifest for the image built from
source commit `5a3d2204165b2662b7a432d30e124999c737b132` in CI run
`33693777354`, after every matrix job completed successfully. The image config
revision matches the source commit. The CI job also verified the non-root user,
image healthcheck, provenance/SBOM metadata, container health, runtime UID, and
bounded viewer health endpoint. No credentials, cookies, tokens, passwords, or
OTPs are included in this record.
